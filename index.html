                9/16/2022 I built a paper boat to see how much weight could float on a single piece of paper. It last longer than 5 minutes

           For the past couple of weeks I along with kyle, and collin had to build a structure that would pop a ballon. mr.poole called it a rue goldburg machine. We were then told to combine what we had all built into one giant machine that would pop a ballon. In the end it worked but we struggled throughout the entire project. We had a hard time deciding what we wanted out machine to look like and making it work was another challenge.

           10/7/22 this week we disected a laptop and rebuilt it after we were done. We would then fill out a worksheet that we had to color and label the specific parts, such as the motherboard cpu gpu etc. I had an easy time disecting the computer but had trouble figuring out which pieces were which. I had never disected a laptop before and I had a lot of fun doing this for the first time.

            10/24/22 Last week me and my partner Jordan had to create a rocket that would launch the farthest in our class. We first had to think of our build of materials(BOM) and decide what they would be used for. Next we had to create a cad of our rocket so when it was time to build we knew what to do. After we would then build our rocket the way we designed it from our cads. Friday was the day we would luanch our rocket.

            10/26/22 this week I was placed into a group and we had to create a filter. We were given a cotton ball, sand, pebbles, and rocks and a water bottle. We first placed the cotton ball then the sand and then placed the pebbles and rocks into the bottle. We then poured dirty water and it did come out cleaner than it was going before however the water was still brown.

            This week mr.poole would teach us about circuts and how they worker. We spent our monday just leraning and understanding what a circut was and how it worked. After we went on tinker cad and created our own circut following the slide mr.poole uploaded. We made a basic circut with a 9v battery, breadboard, resistor, and an LED. Then we created our own circut in real life with a breadboard and everything. Me and my partner Noah spent the entire day making circuts. Then on challenge day we wrote an entire essay analysis on wether we would learn more counting to 1 million or taking a 1 year math class.We also had to prove our answer and convince mr.poole. We agreed that it would be more beneficial to take a math class. However at the end mr.poole said there was no way to prove within the year we would learn anything from the math class. Also counting to 1 million was a goal with an objective end.

            This week we would make code to sequence our arduino LEDs. Me and my partner Noah used A website and just plugged in how long we wanted our delay. Next we showed mr.poole because and he would set up the sequence because it wasn't able to work on our chromebooks. I wasn't here for Thursday or Friday
